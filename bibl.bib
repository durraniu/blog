abstract = {As an approximation based on various experiments reported in the literature, the least detectable difference in speed ($\delta$ w) varies in direct proportion to the speed (w) over a range from 0.1 to 20 degrees of visual angle per second. The constancy of the Weber ratio ($\delta$w/w) aids in understanding how men react to velocity in various situations.},
