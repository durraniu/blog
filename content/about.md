![Welcome!](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGGDNsLvqsBOhuU0/giphy.gif)

My name is Umair Durrani and I have over 5 years of experience in traffic data analysis and driver behavior. I use tools such as PTV VISSIM, R, RStudio, Python and Excel for analysis and reporting the insights gained about road transportation.

My passion is to effectively use data to improve safety and traffic flow on transportation systems. For this purpose, I don't merely rely on black box tools to predict traffic flow but also try to disseminate the knowledge from data to understand the underlying causes e.g. drivers' control strategies and perception limits. These insights are valuable in transforming the future of transportation.

I work really well in a team and like others to succeed. These attributes of my personality enhance my love for teaching, especially the complex technical concepts that are harder to communicate.

I am currently looking for that next position that will allow me to work on cutting-edge research and development projects and data product developments in the transportation industry that would positively impact the future of transportation.
