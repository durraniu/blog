## Study 1

### Weber ratio for visual discrimination of velocity  

Citation: [@Brown1960]  

#### General:     

* What is Weber's Law?        

The ratio of the increment threshold to the background intensity is a constant [@weberlaw].   

$$ {\Delta}I/I = K  $$  

where,

$$ {\Delta}I $$   = the incremental threshold for dtecting a difference   
$$ I  $$   = background intensity   

* Video introduction to Weber's Law:

#### Paper's content:     

* **For discrimination of velocity:** A weber ratio (difference threshold in angular velocity divided by angular velocity) of 0.1 was estimated  
* The differential threshold increases in direct proportion to the angular speed of the stimulus
