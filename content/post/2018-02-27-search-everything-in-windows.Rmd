I just watched a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/boKFxBniUH0) by Hadley Wickham (author of several R packages) who talked about project workflow. He told about using a search and launch application called alfred. Since alfred is only available on Mac, I searched alternatives for Windows. The one I liked among many is [Everything](http://www.voidtools.com/). It makes Windows search so fast. Following is a little demonstration by someone on YouTube.
