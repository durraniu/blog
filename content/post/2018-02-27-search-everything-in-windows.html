<p>I just watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/boKFxBniUH0">YouTube video</a> by Hadley Wickham (author of several R packages) who talked about project workflow. He told about using a search and launch application called alfred. Since alfred is only available on Mac, I searched alternatives for Windows. The one I liked among many is <a href="http://www.voidtools.com/">Everything</a>. It makes Windows search so fast. Following is a little demonstration by someone on YouTube.</p>
